This is a small React app created for a concrete countertop company. It includes an image slider, a form for users to request estimates, and is styled using CSS.

## Features
- **Image Slider:** Displays images of concrete countertops. I used React's `useState` hook to create a functional image slider.
- **Get Estimate Button:** This button triggers the form using Formspree to collect user data.
- **Form:** Integrated a form using Formspree to gather user information for an estimate request.
- **Styling:** Custom styling done with pure CSS for a clean and modern look.
